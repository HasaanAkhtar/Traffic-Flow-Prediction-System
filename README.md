# Traffic-Flow-Prediction-System

A machine learning based application developed which utilizes historical data from VIC roads about traffic on different locations based on coordinates and times. The data is used to train machine learning model to predict the traffic flow on intersections/street and help navigate through the least congested route possible. For the GUI I used python flask for creating map application and later used the model as a reference to provide user with the least time-consuming path between two locations.
